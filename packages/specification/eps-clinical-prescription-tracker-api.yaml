    ## Overview
    Use this API to provide real-time tracking of prescriptions within the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS). It enables authorized users to retrieve details about prescription status, dispensation progress, and other essential prescription lifecycle information.

    This API is designed to be used by healthcare providers, dispensers, and authorized NHS applications to track prescriptions from issuance to fulfillment.

    ## Who can use this API
    The Clinical Prescription Tracker API is intended for use by assured PMR systems which have a use case to add prescription tracking functionality into their system.

    ## Access modes
    This API only supports [user-restricted] access(https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), 
    meaning we authenticate the end user.

    This API is for Healthcare worker access only and follows the [CIS2 separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation).
    
    ## API Status and Roadmap
    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning the API will soon be available for testing via a sandbox service or an integration environment - but we expect to make breaking changes based on developer feedback.

    ## Service level
    This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

    See [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels) for more details.

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/).

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against FHIR UK Core, specifically [UK Core R4 (v4.0.1)](https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API. The API only supports POST requests containing FHIR messages.

    FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    These rules mean:
    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Bundle` not `/bundle`
    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    * data items that are country specific and not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and software development kits](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) available to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network Access
    This API is available on the internet. For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not.
    They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    Your software must be approved by us before you can begin the EPS onboarding process and go live with this FHIR API. EPS 'onboarding' is the term used for the development and assurance required before IT suppliers can offer EPS to NHS organisations.
    
    Details of the onboarding process can be found on our [EPS onboarding and assurance for IT suppliers] (https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/guidance-for-suppliers#:~:text=Electronic%20Prescription%20Service%20(EPS)%20',offer%20EPS%20to%20NHS%20organisations.) page.
